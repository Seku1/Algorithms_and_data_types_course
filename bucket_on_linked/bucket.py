# this algorithm is implementation of bucket sort algorithm because our data is continuous.
# First we create lists of heads and tails of each bucket, so we are creating bucket each bucket has a size of
# 10 divided by length of our array. Next we put every element in their correct bucket, finally we are connecting
# our bucket from last one to the first one
